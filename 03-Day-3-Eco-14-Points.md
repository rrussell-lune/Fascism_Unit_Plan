# Day 3: Eco's Fourteen Points

## Framework Delivery + Application

**Duration:** 70 minutes (includes 5-min check-in)  
**Unit:** [[00-Unit-Overview|The Seduction of Certainty]]  
**Previous:** [[02-Day-2-Contemporary-Voices|Day 2: Contemporary Voices]]  
**Next:** [[04-Day-4-Mishima|Day 4: Mishima]]

## Purpose

Students receive Eco's diagnostic framework and apply it to Day 2's quotes. The key learning moment: discovering that Clinton, Biden, and Robinson don't fit the pattern. This forces the distinction between "fascist" and "violent/harmful."

## Lesson Flow

### Check-In (5 min)

### Opening Connection (5 min)

> "Yesterday you encountered nine voices. Some probably felt similar. Some probably surprised you — especially the last three."
>
> "Today we're getting a tool. Not to tell you what to think, but to help you see what kind of thing you're looking at."
>
> "This comes from Umberto Eco, an Italian scholar who grew up under Mussolini. He spent his life trying to define fascism — not as a fixed ideology, but as a syndrome. A pattern of features that show up together."

### Introduce Eco's 14 Points (15 min)

Distribute Eco handout. Read through the 14 features together.

For each, give the plain-English version. Move at steady pace.

1. **Cult of tradition** — The answers are already in the past
2. **Rejection of modernism** — Enlightenment values (reason, progress) are the problem
3. **Cult of action** — Thinking is suspicious; just do something
4. **Disagreement is treason** — Critics are enemies
5. **Fear of difference** — Outsiders are inherently threatening
6. **Appeal to frustrated middle class** — People who feel they've lost status
7. **Obsession with a plot** — Someone is conspiring against us
8. **Enemy is both strong and weak** — Overwhelming threat we'll definitely defeat
9. **Life is permanent warfare** — No peace, only struggle
10. **Contempt for the weak** — Strength is everything; weakness is shameful
11. **Cult of death** — Heroic death is the highest honour
12. **Machismo** — Rigid gender roles, contempt for "softness"
13. **Selective populism** — The leader speaks for "the people" (but defines who counts)
14. **Newspeak** — Impoverished vocabulary prevents complex thought

> "Notice: some of these contradict each other. The enemy is both strong AND weak? That's irrational. Eco's point is that fascism doesn't need logical consistency. It runs on feeling."

### Group Application (25 min)

Groups of 3-4. Each group gets chart paper.

**Task:** Return to Day 2's quotes (now with attributions). For each speaker, identify which Eco features are present.

Create a grid:
- Speakers across the top (Orbán, Meloni, Modi, Trump, Musk, Tate, Clinton, Biden, Robinson)
- Features down the side (or just use numbers 1-14)
- Mark which features appear where

> "You might find a quote has three or four features. You might find one has almost none. You might disagree about whether a feature is present. The disagreement is where the thinking happens."

**Teacher circulates, asks:**
- *"What words in the quote tell you that?"*
- *"Is that #5 or #7? What's the difference?"*
- *"Which features keep showing up together?"*

### Whole-Class Pattern Analysis (15 min)

Bring groups back. Collate observations on board.

**Guiding questions:**

*"Which features appeared most frequently?"*
- Likely: #5 (fear of difference), #7 (obsession with plot), #12 (machismo)

*"Which speakers showed the most features?"*
- Likely: Orbán, Meloni, Trump, Tate

*"Which speakers didn't fit the pattern?"*

**THE CRUCIAL MOMENT:**
Students will notice Clinton, Biden, and Robinson don't map neatly.

> "So what do we do with those? Clinton, Biden, Robinson — they don't hit most of these features. Are they not dangerous? Not violent? Not worth criticizing?"

Let them wrestle. Don't resolve immediately.

> "Eco's tool helps us identify fascism specifically. It doesn't mean non-fascist politics can't be violent, imperial, or harmful. It means we need different tools for different problems."
>
> "Biden can advocate for killing 22 million people without being a fascist. That's still worth criticizing. It's just a different kind of thing."

**Why precision matters:**

> "If 'fascist' becomes a word for 'anything bad,' it stops meaning anything. And if it stops meaning anything, we can't identify the specific danger fascism poses. The antifascist toolkit doesn't work on everything."

### Closing (5 min)

> "Tomorrow we'll go deeper: not what fascism IS, but why people WANT it. We'll look at someone who chose it with his eyes open."

## Teacher Notes

### Why the outliers matter
Clinton/Biden/Robinson are there to prevent "fascist = bad politics I don't like." Liberal imperialism is violent but structurally different. Different diagnosis requires different response.

### If students insist Biden is fascist
Push them through the tool: *"Show me which points. Walk me through it."* They'll find some (#9 life is warfare, maybe #10 contempt), but they'll struggle with #1, #2, #5, #7, #12. That struggle IS the learning.

### If students resist the distinction
*"I hear you. It can feel like we're letting Biden off the hook. We're not. We're saying his violence is a different kind. Would you treat a broken arm and pneumonia the same way? They're both bad. They need different treatments."*

### Common patterns students notice
- #5 and #7 appear together constantly
- #12 (machismo) shows up in Tate obviously, but underlies others
- The "enemy both strong and weak" (#8) is easiest in Trump/Modi/Orbán

## Connection to Day 2

Make explicit throughout:
- *"Remember the 'us vs. them' pattern? Eco calls that #5 and #7."*
- *"The 'strength' theme? Eco breaks it into #3, #10, and #9."*
- *"The family and tradition quotes? That's #1 and #2."*

## Differentiation

| Student Need | Accommodation |
|--------------|---------------|
| ELL students | Simplified Eco handout; partner during group work |
| Students who need more structure | Provide chart template with features pre-listed |
| Students who finish quickly | Push them on the outliers: "Why DOESN'T Clinton fit?" |
| Students who struggle with abstraction | Focus on one or two features at a time |

---

## Assessment

**Formative.** The tracking chart shows whether students can identify features and cite evidence.
