# Day 5: Synthesis and Application

## PEEL Instruction, Assessment, and Reflection

**Duration:** 70 minutes (or 65 Wednesday)  
**Unit:** [[00-Unit-Overview|The Seduction of Certainty]]  
**Previous:** [[04-Day-4-Mishima|Day 4: Mishima]]  
**Next:** —

## Purpose

Students learn PEEL paragraph structure (Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link), apply it to their Eco/Mishima analysis, receive feedback on their first paragraph, then continue with the assignment. Final reflection is homework.

## Lesson Flow

### Opening: What Have We Done? (5 min)

Quick recap of the unit arc:

> "Day 1: We talked about overwhelm, certainty, belonging—what people want when the world doesn't make sense."
>
> "Day 2: You encountered rhetoric without knowing its source. You found patterns. You learned the sources were current political leaders and a historical fascist."
>
> "Day 3: You got Eco's framework and tested it against those sources."
>
> "Day 4: You met Mishima, who lived fascism's aesthetic dimension to its end."
>
> "Today: You learn how to structure analytical arguments, then apply what you've learned."

### PEEL Instruction (15 min)

Distribute **PEEL Paragraph Guide**.

> "Before you write your analysis, you need a structure. PEEL is how you build an argument that actually convinces."

**Walk through the components:**

- **Point:** Name the Eco feature + make a claim about Mishima
- **Evidence:** Quote Mishima directly from the primary sources
- **Explanation:** HOW does the quote prove your point? WHY does it matter for understanding fascism?
- **Link:** Connect to another feature, the paradox, or fascism's broader logic

**Model with the example on page 2:**

Read the weak example aloud. Ask: "What's wrong here?"
- Point is vague
- Evidence is summary, not quotes
- No explanation
- Link just restates

Read the strong example aloud. Walk through the annotations.
- Note how it names a specific Eco feature
- Note how it quotes directly
- Note how it explains *why* this matters (not just that it's there)
- Note how the link moves forward to another feature

> "Your analysis will be built from PEEL paragraphs. The assignment asks you to show patterns—your Links are where that happens."

### Introduce Assessment & Format Options (5 min)

Distribute **Eco Application Assignment** sheet. Quick overview:

> "You have format choices: written analysis, annotated visual, audio/video, or structured organiser. All formats use PEEL structure. Choose what lets you show your thinking best."
>
> "Whatever format you choose, you need: Point + Evidence + Explanation + Link. The structured organiser on page 3 makes this explicit."

### First Paragraph: Write and Check (20 min)

**The checkpoint:**

> "Pick one Eco feature you see clearly in Mishima. Write your first PEEL paragraph now. When you're done, raise your hand. I'll come check it before you continue."

Students write. Teacher circulates.

**What to look for:**
- Is the Point specific (names Eco feature + makes a claim)?
- Is the Evidence a direct quote (not summary)?
- Does the Explanation connect Evidence to Point AND explain why it matters?
- Does the Link move forward (not just restate)?

**Feedback format (star and wish):**
- "Your point is clear because... To strengthen your explanation, try..."
- "Good quote choice. Now show me WHY this proves your point."
- "You've got the structure. Push deeper on what this reveals about fascism."

Clear students to continue once their first paragraph demonstrates understanding.

### Work Time (20 min)

Students continue their analysis. Options:

1. **Return to sources:** Reread primary source excerpts with Eco's features in mind
2. **Continue drafting:** Build additional PEEL paragraphs
3. **Consult with teacher:** If struggling to connect features to evidence

**Common challenges to address:**
- Listing features without showing how they connect (remind them: Links create patterns)
- Ignoring the paradox or treating it superficially
- Not quoting primary sources directly
- Forcing features that don't fit instead of noting complications

### Closing: Reflection Assignment (5 min)

Distribute **Final Reflection Prompts**.

> "This is homework. Due [next class / end of week]. The reflection asks you to think about what shifted for you during this unit—what you understand now about fascism's appeal, what questions remain."
>
> "Honesty matters more than right answers. If you felt the appeal of something, say so. If something doesn't fit the framework, say so. The goal is genuine thinking."

**Eco Application due:** [specify date]  
**Final Reflection due:** [specify date]

## Teacher Notes

### Why PEEL here?
Students need structure for analytical writing. Teaching PEEL in context (with material they know) is more effective than teaching it abstractly. This also sequences skills for the Venezuela unit: here they learn structure; there they'll focus on evidence evaluation.

### The checkpoint model
Having students write one paragraph and check in before continuing:
- Catches misunderstandings early
- Gives everyone individualised feedback
- Ensures no one spends 30 minutes on the wrong track
- Models that first drafts get feedback (not just final products)

### Reflection as homework
Moving reflection to homework keeps Day 5 focused on PEEL + application. The reflection benefits from time to think anyway. Students who finish the application early can start the reflection in class.

### Grading philosophy
**Eco Application:** Tests whether students can use the framework analytically on a difficult case, with properly structured arguments. Look for PEEL structure + engagement with patterns and paradox.

**Final Reflection:** Tests whether they've engaged genuinely with the questions underneath the framework. Grade for depth of engagement and honesty, not "correct" answers.

## Differentiation

| Student Need | Accommodation |
|--------------|---------------|
| Students who struggle with PEEL | Focus them on Option D (structured organiser) |
| ELL students | Use [[Student Handouts/05 - Eco Application Assignment ELL.docx\|ELL version]] with sentence frames |
| Students who want challenge | Push them on paradox and complications |
| Students who finish early | Start reflection in class, or peer-review another's paragraph |
