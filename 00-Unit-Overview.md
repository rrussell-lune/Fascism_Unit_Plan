# The Seduction of Certainty

## Fascism, Psychology, and the Appeal of Simple Answers

**Social Studies 10 | Ryan Russell | Seaquam Secondary**

---

## Unit Overview

This unit examines fascism not as a historical aberration to be condemned from a safe distance, but as a persistent psychological and political phenomenon that emerges from recognisable human needs. Students investigate why fascism is alluring, how it recruits through emotional appeal rather than rational argument, and what conditions make populations susceptible to its promises.

The pedagogical approach draws from Paulo Freire's problem-posing education and Derek R. Ford's concept of the encounter: students experience the psychological pull of fascist rhetoric and aesthetics before receiving theoretical frameworks for analysis. The goal is critical consciousness through felt experience, not content delivery through lecture.

## Duration

5-6 class periods (approximately 1.5 weeks on linear block schedule)

- Standard blocks: 70 minutes
- Wednesday blocks: 65 minutes
- Target: Late January 2026 (post-Venezuela unit, pre-WWI content)

## Why This Unit

Students encounter fascist rhetoric constantly: in online spaces, in political movements, in aesthetic trends, in the language of strength and purity and decline. Most curriculum treats fascism as self-evidently evil, presenting it as something that happened in the 1930s to people who were obviously wrong. This approach fails because it doesn't explain why millions of people found fascism compelling, or why similar movements continue to attract followers today.

If we want students to recognise and resist fascist appeals, we need to help them understand what fascism offers: certainty in an uncertain world, belonging in an atomised society, purpose in a meaningless existence, strength in a moment of felt weakness. These are not stupid desires. They are deeply human. Fascism exploits them.

This unit takes fascism seriously as an object of study, which means taking seriously why people are drawn to it. Students will encounter fascist rhetoric and aesthetics, feel their pull, and then develop analytical tools for understanding that pull. The sequence matters: encounter first, then framework.

## Theoretical Influences

### Paulo Freire: Problem-Posing Education

Traditional education treats students as empty vessels to be filled with correct information (what Freire calls the "banking model"). Problem-posing education instead treats students as co-investigators of reality, presenting contradictions and tensions for collective examination. In this unit, the contradiction is: Why do movements that lead to catastrophic violence feel so appealing to so many people?

### Derek R. Ford: The Pedagogical Encounter

Ford argues that genuine learning happens through encounters that disrupt our existing frameworks, not through smooth transmission of information. An encounter creates a productive rupture: something doesn't fit, and we have to reorganise our understanding to accommodate it. This unit is structured around encounters: the Socratic circle questions that surface students' own susceptibilities, the unlabelled contemporary voices that reveal how fascist rhetoric sounds today, the Mishima case study that embodies fascism's aesthetic dimension.

### Siegfried Kracauer: The Mass Ornament

Kracauer's analysis of Weimar Germany traces how economic crisis and social atomisation created a population psychologically disposed to surrender autonomy to authority. His reading of German cinema reveals recurring patterns: men overwhelmed by society, yearning to return to childhood or the womb, seeking a strong father figure to take control. This psychological disposition, not ideology, explains fascism's appeal. The unit foregrounds Kracauer's insight: fascism doesn't primarily offer ideas, it offers relief from the burden of selfhood.

### Umberto Eco: Ur-Fascism

Eco's 14 features of "eternal fascism" provide a diagnostic toolkit students can apply to contemporary movements. Crucially, Eco argues that fascism is a syndrome, not an ideology: any combination of features can produce a recognisably fascist politics. This prevents the common dodge of "that's not technically fascism because..." The features are observable, applicable, and pedagogically useful.

### Pasolini: Salò and the Logic of Fascism

Pasolini's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom depicts fascism's logical endpoint: the reduction of human beings to consumable objects. While we obviously cannot show the film, its core insight matters: fascism promises to elevate the in-group but ultimately reduces everyone to meat. The aesthetic dimension (fascism's obsession with beauty, purity, the body) leads to the annihilation of the body. This paradox structures the Mishima case study.

## Enduring Understandings

1. **Fascism appeals to real human needs.** The desire for certainty, belonging, purpose, and strength are not pathological. Fascism exploits these needs rather than addressing them.

2. **Fascism is primarily aesthetic and affective, not ideological.** Fascism recruits through feeling (spectacle, beauty, sublime violence, group belonging) rather than through rational argument. Understanding this is essential to recognising and resisting its appeals.

3. **Crisis conditions create susceptibility.** Economic instability, social atomisation, identity threat, and perceived decline make populations receptive to fascist promises. These conditions can be created, intensified, or manufactured.

4. **Fascism offers an exit from the burden of freedom.** The responsibility of making choices in an uncertain world is exhausting. Fascism promises to take that burden away: surrender to the leader, the movement, the nation, and you no longer have to think.

5. **The endpoint of fascism is annihilation.** Despite its aestheticisation of beauty and strength, fascism ultimately reduces human beings to objects to be used and discarded. The logic of purity leads to extermination.

---

## Essential Questions

1. **Why is fascism so alluring?** What does it offer that other political movements don't? Why do people choose it?

2. **When is it reasonable to let someone else make decisions for you?** Where is the line between healthy dependence (doctors, teachers, experts) and dangerous surrender of autonomy?

3. **What conditions make people susceptible to fascist appeals?** How do economic crisis, social isolation, and identity threat create openings for these movements?

4. **Can you recognise fascist rhetoric when it doesn't announce itself as fascism?** What does it sound like today? How do you know?

5. **Is there something seductive about certainty itself?** Why does being absolutely sure feel so good? When is that feeling a warning sign?

## Unit Structure: The Encounter-First Sequence

### [[01-Day-1-Socratic-Circle|Day 1: The Socratic Circle]]
Students bring their Socratic Circle prep notes. Inner/outer Socratic circle format. No fascism content yet, just the psychological and existential questions: overwhelm, autonomy, identity, certainty, belonging. Students discover their own susceptibilities before encountering fascist material.

### [[02-Day-2-Contemporary-Voices|Day 2: Contemporary Voices]]
Students receive unlabelled quotes from contemporary political figures (Orbán, Meloni, Le Pen) alongside Mussolini. They sort, analyse, and identify common themes. The reveal: these are current leaders with millions of followers. The encounter: fascist rhetoric is alive and sounds appealing to many people.

### [[03-Day-3-Eco-14-Points|Day 3: Eco's Fourteen Points]]
Students receive Eco's diagnostic framework and apply it to the Day 2 quotes. They discover which features appear, which are absent, and how the syndrome manifests. The framework becomes useful because they've already felt its necessity.

### [[04-Day-4-Mishima|Day 4: Mishima (The Aesthetic Dimension)]]
Case study: Yukio Mishima. Film clips, primary sources (Sun and Steel, Confessions of a Mask), biographical context. Students examine how fascism operates through beauty, the body, and aesthetic experience. The paradox: obsession with physical perfection leading to self-destruction.

### [[05-Day-5-Synthesis|Day 5: Synthesis and Application]]
Students learn PEEL paragraph structure (Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link) as a tool for analytical writing. They write their first PEEL paragraph applying an Eco feature to Mishima, receive individualised feedback, then continue with the full assignment. Reflection is homework. This sequences skills for the Venezuela unit: structure now, evidence evaluation later.

### Optional Day 6: Political Compass/8Values Activity
Students take political placement quiz, discuss results, examine the limitations of left-right frameworks, consider where fascism fits (and why it often evades simple categorisation).

---

## Assessment Philosophy

**In-class participation is formative, not summative.**

Students are NOT graded on saying the right things in Socratic circles or reaching particular conclusions. The discussions are learning spaces where students can think aloud, change their minds, and sit with discomfort.

---

## Summative Assessment

| Assessment | Day | Competency | Weight |
|------------|-----|------------|--------|
| Eco Application | 5 | Evidence evaluation, perspective analysis | 1x |
| Final Reflection | 5 | Synthesis, metacognition | 1x |

**1. Eco Application (Day 5)**
Students analyse Yukio Mishima using Eco's 14 features, structured as PEEL paragraphs. Multiple format options available (written, visual, audio/video, structured organiser). The goal is to understand how fascism functioned in Mishima's life and thought, engaging with the paradox of beauty leading to destruction.

**2. Final Reflection (Day 5)**
Students respond to essential questions, connecting specific unit moments to broader insights about psychology, politics, and their own susceptibilities.

## Key Pedagogical Moves

### Encounter-First Design
Students experience the psychological pull of fascist appeals before receiving analytical frameworks. The Socratic circle on Day 1 surfaces their own desires for certainty, belonging, and relief from overwhelm. The unlabelled quotes on Day 2 let them feel the rhetoric's appeal before knowing its source. Eco arrives on Day 3 because they now need a tool for understanding what they've experienced.

### Taking Fascism Seriously
The unit refuses to treat fascism as obviously evil and historically contained. Students examine why intelligent, sensitive people were drawn to fascist movements, and what contemporary versions sound like. This is not apologia; it's the only way to develop genuine critical resistance.

### The Mishima Paradox
Mishima embodies fascism's aesthetic dimension: beauty, the body, discipline, sacrifice, sublime violence. His case reveals the internal logic that leads from physical perfection to self-destruction. Students sit with a figure who was brilliant, sensitive, and chose death for fascist ideals. This is uncomfortable. That discomfort is productive.

### Student Co-Investigation
Students are not told what to conclude about fascism. They apply Eco's framework themselves, identify features in contemporary rhetoric themselves, and form their own assessments. The teacher's role is to create conditions for encounter and provide analytical tools, not to deliver verdicts.

## A Note on This Material

This unit asks students to engage seriously with material that has caused tremendous suffering. Fascism is not an abstract historical phenomenon; it killed millions of people and continues to threaten lives today.

At the same time, treating fascism as incomprehensible evil prevents us from understanding why it appeals to people, which prevents us from effectively resisting it. The unit walks this line carefully: taking fascism seriously as an object of study while never losing sight of its real-world consequences.

Some students may have personal connections to fascist violence (family history, contemporary experiences of far-right harassment). Be attentive to this and ready to provide support.

Some students may find fascist rhetoric genuinely appealing. This is not a disaster; it's an opportunity. The unit is designed to help students understand and critically examine that appeal, not to shame them for feeling it.

## Connection to WWI Unit

Day 4 includes an optional extension using Ernst Jünger's *Storm of Steel* (1920), a WWI memoir that aestheticizes trench warfare in ways that directly anticipate Mishima's "sun and steel" imagery:

> "We had come from lecture halls, school desks and factory workbenches... Grown up in an age of security, we shared a yearning for danger, for the experience of the extraordinary. We were enraptured by war."

This creates a direct bridge to the WWI unit: the generation that fought in the trenches and returned transformed became the foot soldiers of European fascism. The yearning for intensity, for transcendence through violence, for meaning through struggle—this is what fascism promised to restore.

---

## Connection to Observation

See [[Observation-Lesson-Jan-31]] for the detailed observation-ready lesson plan combining Days 1-2. The lesson demonstrates:

- **Clear learning objectives shared with students** (Eco's framework, Mishima's embodiment of fascist aesthetics)
- **Variety of teaching strategies** (small group analysis, whole class discussion, primary source work, media analysis)
- **Engagement of all learners** (structured roles, multiple entry points, accommodations embedded)
- **Effective questioning techniques** (open-ended questions driving inquiry, follow-up probes)
- **Welcoming, inclusive environment** (norms established, discomfort expected but supported)
- **Personal philosophy informed by research** (Ford/Freire encounter pedagogy, explicit rationale)
