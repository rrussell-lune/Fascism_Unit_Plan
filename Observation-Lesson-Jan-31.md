## Learning Intentions

By the end of this lesson, students will:

1. **Articulate** the psychological conditions that make people susceptible to certain political appeals (certainty, belonging, relief from overwhelm)
2. **Encounter** contemporary political rhetoric without predetermined frameworks
3. **Notice** patterns across speakers before knowing who they are
4. **Sit with** the discomfort of recognising appeal in rhetoric they might otherwise dismiss

---

## Curricular Competencies (BC Social Studies 10)

**Questioning and Investigating**
- Assess the credibility of multiple sources and the adequacy of evidence used to justify conclusions

**Processing and Analyzing**
- Explain and compare different perspectives on past and present people, places, issues, and events

**Communicating**
- Take stakeholder actions on issues as appropriate, through ethical reasoning and argumentation

---

## Pedagogical Rationale

### Why This Sequence Matters

This lesson sits at the heart of encounter-first pedagogy. Drawing from Paulo Freire's problem-posing education and Derek R. Ford's concept of the pedagogical encounter, students experience fascist rhetoric's appeal *before* receiving analytical frameworks. This sequencing is intentional:

> "An encounter creates a productive rupture: something doesn't fit, and we have to reorganise our understanding to accommodate it." (Ford, *Encountering Education*)

Traditional approaches to teaching fascism present it as self-evidently evil, something that happened to "those people" in the 1930s. This fails because it doesn't explain why millions found it compelling, or why similar movements attract followers today. **Students cannot develop genuine critical resistance to something they haven't felt the pull of.**

### The Socratic Circle's Purpose

The Socratic circle questions surface students' own susceptibilities: their desires for certainty when overwhelmed, for belonging when atomised, for someone to take control when burdened by choice. These are not pathological desires. They are deeply human. Fascism exploits them.

By beginning with psychology rather than politics, students discover that **they too** have felt what fascism promises to address. This personal recognition transforms the unit from academic content delivery into genuine co-investigation.

### The Contemporary Voices Encounter

Students receive nine unlabelled quotes from contemporary political figures. They don't know who said what. They react honestly, guess the speakers, and notice patterns.

The reveal creates a second rupture: the rhetoric that sounded alarming (or appealing) belongs to current leaders with millions of followers. Fascism isn't history. The encounter is now.

Three quotes come from figures students likely consider "normal" politicians (Clinton, Biden, Robinson). Many students will assume these don't belong with Orbán and Trump. **That assumption is the trap.** When we apply Eco's framework on Day 3, students discover these quotes fit too: Clinton's gleeful "we came, we saw, he died" (cult of action, contempt for the weak, machismo); Biden's casual reference to killing 22 million people (permanent warfare, selective populism); Robinson's "nothing on it" (fear of difference, cult of tradition, selective populism that defines Indigenous people out of "the people").

The real question becomes: *Why did we want to believe they were different?*

## Detailed Lesson Flow

### Check-In (5 min)

Standard community builder. Brief: check in on students after Math mid-terms, plans for the weekend, vibe check.

To begin, a simple thumbs up/middle/down from everybody has them give me some sign of how they are doing, even those that do not wish to speak.

**Transition to framing:**

> "Last class, we started a conversation about what people want when they feel overwhelmed, when their identity feels threatened, when the world doesn't make sense. We didn't finish. Today we're going to complete that Socratic circle, and then you're going to encounter some voices that speak directly to those feelings."

---

### Socratic Circle Completion (25 min)

#### Setup Reminder (2 min)

> "Same norms as last time: Snowball to start, but if we get flowing we do not need to stick with it. Build on each other. Ask questions. Change your mind out loud. The goal is understanding."

### Where We Left Off (Context for Observer)

Last class ended mid-conversation with a deliberately provocative question:

> "Wouldn't the world be a safer, better place with more police, more cameras on every building, in every classroom, even the washrooms—without seeing into the stalls, of course?"

When students resisted, I played devil's advocate: *"What are you hiding? If you're not doing anything wrong, why would you care?"*

This connects to the **panopticon effect** (Foucault): the idea that constant surveillance changes behaviour even when no one is actively watching. You internalise the gaze. You police yourself.

**Why this matters for the unit:** The "nothing to hide" argument is one of the most seductive entry points into authoritarian logic. It trades freedom for security, autonomy for certainty. Students who felt uncomfortable with the surveillance question but couldn't articulate why are sitting with exactly the tension this unit is designed to surface.

**Today's continuation** picks up from that discomfort and pushes toward the deeper questions: What kind of message appeals to someone who feels unsafe? What are we willing to give up for the promise of certainty?

---

### Socratic Circle Continuation (25 min)

*Format: Perimeter circle (whole class). No inner/outer rotation today.*
#### Reopening (3 min)

> "Last time we ended with a question about surveillance. Some of you were uncomfortable. Some of you couldn't say why. Let's sit with that."
>
> "Remember the panopticon? The prison designed so inmates never know if they're being watched, so they behave as if they always are. What does it do to a person to live like that?"

#### The Seduction (12 min)

Transition from surveillance to the broader question:

> "So if constant watching feels wrong, why do people accept it? What would make someone say yes to that?"
>
> "Imagine someone who feels powerless, confused, anxious about the future, like the world doesn't make sense. What kind of message would appeal to them? What would it promise?"

**Follow-up probes if needed:**
- "Is there something pleasurable about certainty itself?"
- "What's the difference between being reassured and being seduced?"
- "The surveillance state promises safety. What's the cost? When is that cost worth it?"

#### Dangerous Truths (10 min)

> "Can something feel true and powerful but actually be dangerous? How would you know?"

**Follow-up probes if needed:**
- "The 'nothing to hide' argument feels logical. Is it?"
- "What makes something feel true? What makes it actually true?"
- "What would convince you that something you felt deeply was actually wrong?
#### Whole-Class Synthesis (No full debrief yet) (2 min)

Don't resolve. Simply observe:

> "Notice what's on the board. Certainty. Belonging. Enemies. Strength. Simple answers. Hold onto these. We're about to meet some people who thought very hard about exactly these things. We'll see what we think of their answers."

---

### Transition: Contemporary Voices (3 min)

Distribute **Contemporary Voices Handout** face-down.

> "Don't flip yet. When you do, you'll find nine quotes. Read each one carefully. For each quote, write three things: (1) your honest reaction, (2) who you think said this, (3) whether you'd share this approvingly, hide that you agreed, or strongly disagree."
>
> "This is individual and silent. Don't Google. Don't talk. Just read and react. There's also a reflection activity on the back—get to that when you're done with the quotes."

---

### Individual Encounter (20 min)

Students flip handouts and work through all nine quotes plus back page activity.

**Teacher moves:** Circulate silently. If students ask who said something: *"Write down your guess."* If students finish early, ensure they've completed the back page. Note which quotes generate visible reactions.

**What you're observing:**
- Do students pause at certain quotes?
- Do they write quickly (confident reactions) or slowly (processing)?
- Any visible emotional responses?

---

### Pair Discussion (5 min)

Students pair up (shoulder partner or nearby).

> "Compare your reactions. Which quotes did you respond to most strongly? Did you guess similar speakers? Which quote doesn't fit with the others?"

**No whole-class share yet.** Keep the tension.

---

### The Reveal: Quotes 1-3 (12 min)

*Note: We'll likely only get through 3-4 quotes today. That's fine—the encounter matters more than rushing the reveal.*

Project slides. Go through quotes 1-5 one at a time (save 6-9 for Day 3).

**Structure for each reveal:**
1. Show quote (students already have it)
2. Reveal speaker, role, context
3. Pose discussion question
4. 2-3 minutes pair/small-group discussion

#### Quote 1: Viktor Orbán

> "We are willing to mix with one another, but we do not want to become peoples of mixed race."

**Reveal:** Prime Minister of Hungary (2010-present). EU member state. Said at a public festival, July 2022.

**Discussion question:** *Why would "purity" appeal to people who know their own ancestry is mixed? What does it offer?*

#### Quote 2: Giorgia Meloni

> "They want to replace us with immigrants... This is the plan of ethnic substitution... Today they attack our national identity, they attack our religious identity, they want to attack our sexual identity, and we will not let them... because we will defend God, country and family... They will not take that away from us. No to the LGBT lobby, no to gender ideology, no to the violence of Islam, yes to the natural family, yes to the universality of the Cross."

**Reveal:** Prime Minister of Italy (2022-present). Leader of Brothers of Italy party.

**Discussion question:** *Why do anti-immigration and anti-LGBT show up in the same politician? What connects "ethnic substitution" to "the abyss of death"?*

#### Quote 3: Narendra Modi

> "We will have to take a decision about infiltrators... They can be identified by the clothes they wear... This is vote bank politics to protect infiltrators. Congress and its allies want to take away your wealth and give it to infiltrators and those with more children... The urban Naxals and tukde-tukde gang say Muslims have the first right to the nation's resources."

**Reveal:** Prime Minister of India (2014-present). World's largest democracy. Said during 2024 campaign.

**Discussion question:** *How does "protecting mothers and sisters" become justification for targeting others? What work does the word "infiltrators" do?*

#### Quote 4: Donald Trump

> "They're poisoning the blood of our country. That's what they've done. They poison mental institutions and prisons all over the world. Not just in South America. Not just the three or four countries that we think about. But all over the world they're coming into our country, from Africa, from Asia."

**Reveal:** Former and current US President. Said at campaign rally, December 2023.

**Discussion question:** *Why "poisoning the blood" instead of "taking jobs" or "breaking laws"? What does the biological metaphor do?*

#### Quote 5: Elon Musk

> "You have said the actual truth."

**Reveal:** Richest person on Earth. Owner of X (Twitter). Responding to a post claiming Jewish communities push "hatred against whites."

**Discussion question:** *What can the richest man in the world say that you can't? What does owning the platform change?*

---

### Closing: Hold the Tension (3 min)

> "We're stopping here. There are four more quotes. We'll reveal those next class."
>
> "Notice: some of these speakers probably surprised you. Some didn't. Keep your handout. Tomorrow we'll get a tool for thinking about what connects some of these voices, and what separates them from others."
>
> "One question to sit with: What makes something fascist versus just... bad?"

**Do not say the word "fascism" yet.** Let them arrive at it.

## Differentiation Strategies

| Student Need                             | Accommodation                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ELL students                             | Pair with supportive partner during Socratic circle; allow written contributions if verbal too anxiety-provoking; handout vocabulary support available |
| Students who dominate discussion         | Gentle redirect: "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"                                                                                       |
| Students who struggle with ambiguity     | Private reassurance that frameworks are coming; the confusion is intentional                                                                           |
| Students who check out during discussion | Give note-taking role: "Capture key phrases you hear either on paper or keep them stored in memory. We'll use them later"                              |
| Students who find quotes appealing       | Don't shame; notice: "We'll talk about why this rhetoric is designed to be appealing"                                                                  |

## Assessment

### Formative Only

No grades for Socratic circle or initial reactions. You're observing:

- **Engagement quality:** Who thinks aloud? Who builds on others?
- **Honesty:** Are students admitting genuine reactions, or performing expected ones?
- **Pattern recognition:** Do students notice connections across quotes unprompted?
- **Discomfort tolerance:** Who sits with tension? Who rushes to resolve?

These observations inform grouping and scaffolding for Days 3-5.

## Possible Student Responses

### During Socratic Circle

| Student says...                                   | Teacher response                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I've never felt overwhelmed like that."          | "Can you imagine what it might feel like? Or have you seen it in someone else?"       |
| "Isn't it always bad to let someone else decide?" | "Is it? What about when you're sick and the doctor says you need surgery?"            |
| "This is getting too personal."                   | "You can speak about people in general. The questions aren't about exposing secrets." |
| "What's the point of this?"                       | "We're building toward something. The connection will become clear."                  |

### During Reveal

| Student says...                          | Teacher response                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "I knew it was Trump."                   | "What gave it away? What patterns did you notice?"                             |
| "Why is [liberal figure] in here?"       | "Great question. Hold onto it. Tomorrow's tool might help you answer it."      |
| "This is all just racism."               | "Is racism the same as fascism? Are they different? We'll explore that."       |
| "I actually kind of agree with [quote]." | "Notice that. We'll talk about why this rhetoric is designed to be appealing." |

## Connection to Unit Arc

This lesson is **Day 1-2** of the five-day unit "The Seduction of Certainty":

| Day | Focus | This Lesson's Role |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| **1-2** | **Psychology + Encounter** | **We are here** |
| 3 | Eco's 14 Points | Framework for what they've experienced |
| 4 | Mishima Case Study | Fascism's aesthetic dimension |
| 5 | Eco Application + PEEL | Analysis + skill-building |

The sequence matters: encounter creates the need for framework. Without feeling fascism's pull, Eco becomes trivia.

---

## Theoretical Background for Observer

### Why Encounter-First?

Traditional curriculum treats fascism as obviously evil and historically contained. Students memorise that fascism is bad without understanding why anyone was ever drawn to it. This produces two failures:

1. **Students can't recognise fascism** when it doesn't announce itself
2. **Students can't resist fascism** because they haven't examined its genuine appeals

Encounter-first pedagogy, drawing from Freire and Ford, reverses this. Students feel the questions first (Socratic circle), encounter the rhetoric second (unlabelled quotes), and receive analytical tools third (Eco's 14 Points on Day 3).

### The Ford/Freire Connection

Paulo Freire's **problem-posing education** treats students as co-investigators of reality, not empty vessels to fill. The Socratic circle embodies this: students investigate their own susceptibilities to certainty, belonging, and simple answers.

Derek R. Ford's **pedagogical encounter** argues that genuine learning happens through rupture, not transmission. The unlabelled quotes create rupture: rhetoric that sounds alarming (or appealing) belongs to current leaders, not distant history. Something doesn't fit; students must reorganise their understanding.

### Why the "Liberals" Matter

Three quotes come from Clinton, Biden, and Robinson, figures students likely see as mainstream, acceptable, "not like the others." Many will assume these don't fit the pattern.

They do.

- **Clinton** — "We came, we saw, he died": Cult of action (#3), contempt for the weak (#10), machismo (#12), life as permanent warfare (#9). The Caesar cosplay. The laughter at death.
- **Biden** — preemptive nuclear strike on North Korea: Life as permanent warfare (#9), selective populism (#13—"the people" means Americans, not the 22 million), contempt for the weak (#10).
- **Robinson** — "nothing on it": Fear of difference (#5), cult of tradition (#1—settler mythology as origin story), selective populism (#13—who counts as British Columbian?).

The pedagogical point isn't that these are outliers. It's that some **students will want them to be outliers**, and they're not. Day 3's work isn't distinguishing "fascist" from "harmful." It's asking why we're so invested in believing liberalism is categorically different from fascism when the features keep showing up.

Aimé Césaire argued in *Discourse on Colonialism* (1950) that what Europe found unforgivable about Hitler was not the crime against humanity, but "the crime against the white man... the fact that he applied to Europe colonialist procedures which until then had been reserved exclusively for the Arabs of Algeria, the coolies of India, and the blacks of Africa." Hannah Arendt similarly traced how techniques of colonial domination (concentration camps, racial classification, bureaucratised violence) were developed abroad and imported to Europe. The distinction we want to draw protects us from seeing the continuity.

## Post-Lesson Reflection (To Complete After)

*What patterns emerged in the Socratic circle that connect to fascism's appeals?*

*Which quotes generated the strongest reactions? The most confusion?*

*Are students ready for Eco's framework, or do they need more encounter time?*

*What do I want to adjust for Days 3-5 based on what I observed?*
