## Fascism and the Body

**Duration:** 70 minutes (or 65 Wednesday)  
**Unit:** [[00-Unit-Overview|The Seduction of Certainty]]  
**Previous:** [[03-Day-3-Eco-14-Points|Day 3: Eco's Fourteen Points]]  
**Next:** [[05-Day-5-Synthesis|Day 5: Synthesis and Application]]

## Purpose

Students examine Yukio Mishima as a case study in fascism's aesthetic dimension: the obsession with beauty, the body, discipline, sacrifice, and sublime violence. Mishima embodies the paradox that runs through fascism: the pursuit of physical perfection leading to destruction; the worship of life ending in death.

## Content Warning

Mishima's story involves suicide (ritual seppuku), militarism, and extreme nationalism. The film clips may include stylised violence. Alert students to this at the beginning of class and provide alternatives for anyone who needs to step out.

## Who Was Mishima?

**Yukio Mishima (1925–1970)** was one of Japan's greatest writers: novelist, playwright, poet, actor, bodybuilder, samurai revivalist. He was nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was also a fascist who founded a private militia, attempted a coup d'état, and committed ritual suicide when it failed.

Mishima matters for this unit because he makes visible something that often stays hidden: fascism's aesthetic core. His work explicitly explores why beauty, violence, and death belong together. He lived, in his own telling, as a work of art, and he choreographed his death as a final artistic statement.

Students will encounter someone brilliant, sensitive, and disciplined who chose fascism not despite these qualities but through them. This is uncomfortable. That discomfort is pedagogically productive.

## Lesson Flow

### Opening Frame: Sontag (10 min)

> "We've looked at fascist rhetoric and Eco's diagnostic framework. Today we're looking at something different: the aesthetics of fascism. What fascism feels like. Why it's beautiful."
>
> "This class involves discussion of suicide. If you need to step out at any point, that's completely fine."

Distribute **Sontag Excerpts**. Read aloud or have students read the key definition:

> "Fascist aesthetics... flow from (and justify) a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behaviour, extravagant effort, and the endurance of pain; they endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude."

Ask students to work through the "Plain English" translation and the first question: "How can someone feel both egomania and servitude at once?"

Brief discussion (3-4 responses). Then:

> "Keep Sontag's definition in mind. You're about to encounter a figure who embodied exactly what she describes: one of the greatest writers of the 20th century who was also a fascist who staged his own death."

### Biographical Context (8 min)

Distribute **Mishima Biographical Context** handout. Teacher presents key points:

**Early life:** Sickly child, overprotected by grandmother, kept from physical activity. Felt separated from his body, from masculinity, from life itself.

**Literary career:** First novel published at 24. Rapidly became Japan's most famous living writer. Prolific: 34 novels, 50 plays, 200+ short stories.

**Physical transformation:** At 30, began obsessive bodybuilding. Learned kendo, boxing. Posed for photographs. The body became his medium.

**Political turn:** Founded the Tatenokai (Shield Society), a private militia of 100 young men. Trained with Japanese Self-Defence Forces. Became increasingly militant in nationalist politics.

**November 25, 1970:** Led four militia members into the headquarters of Japan's Eastern Army Command. Took the general hostage. Demanded a speech platform. Addressed assembled soldiers for seven minutes, calling for restoration of Imperial power and revision of Japan's pacifist constitution. Was jeered. Went inside. Committed seppuku (ritual disembowelment). His second beheaded him.

### Primary Source Reading (12 min)

Distribute **Mishima Primary Sources** handout. Students read individually, using the "Plain English" translations to help with dense passages.

Key excerpts included:

**From *Sun and Steel* (1968):**
> "The body had existed before words... it was the very essence of existence before words. Gradually, I came to realise that the flesh must be nourished by words—even, in extreme cases, destroyed by them."

> "I cherished a romantic impulse towards death, yet at the same time I required a strictly classical body as its vehicle... a tragic death, for me, was as far removed from everyday life as the peaks of Himalaya."

> "The goal was to achieve a beauty that was both hard and glittering, a sublime and empty shell that was untouched by human warmth."

**From *Confessions of a Mask* (1949):**
> "From the early outset, I had a presentiment of the nature of my existence... that I would never be blessed with those close natural friendships between man and man... that I was fated to live in solitude."

> "My need was for the sun and steel, for the sword, for the violent and the beautiful."

### Discussion: What Do You Notice? (10 min)

Open discussion. Possible questions:

- "What relationship does Mishima have with his body?"
- "He talks about beauty being 'hard,' 'glittering,' 'empty,' 'untouched by human warmth.' What kind of beauty is that?"
- "He says flesh must be 'destroyed by words.' What might that mean?"
- "What needs does he seem to be trying to meet through bodybuilding, discipline, the samurai ideal?"

Don't push toward conclusions yet. Let students articulate what they notice.

### Film Clips (15 min)

Show selected scenes from *Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters* (Paul Schrader, 1985). Recommended clips:

1. **Opening sequence:** Mishima prepares for the final day. The ritual, the uniform, the deliberate choreography.

2. **"Temple of the Golden Pavilion" segment:** The acolyte who burns down the beautiful temple because its beauty is unbearable.

3. **Bodybuilding montage:** The transformation of flesh into sculpture.

4. **Final speech:** Mishima addressing the soldiers, being jeered, going inside.

After clips, give students a moment of silence. This is heavy material.

### Application: Eco Through Mishima (10 min)

Return to Eco's framework. In pairs or small groups:

> "Which of Eco's features do you see in Mishima?"

Likely connections:
- **Cult of tradition:** The samurai code, imperial restoration
- **Rejection of modernism:** Japan's postwar "corruption" under American influence
- **Action for action's sake:** The body, the sword, the deed over words
- **Life is permanent warfare:** Struggle gives meaning; peace is decay
- **Everybody educated to become a hero:** Heroic death as highest aspiration
- **Machismo:** The obsession with masculinity, the body as masculine ideal

But also note what doesn't fit neatly:
- Mishima was a literary intellectual, not anti-intellectual
- His aestheticism is more developed than most fascism
- He was gay (or bisexual), which complicates the machismo analysis

### The Paradox (5 min)

Close with the central paradox:

> "Mishima worshipped beauty, strength, the body, life at its most intense. And he choreographed his own death."
>
> "Fascism promises vitality, strength, the triumph of life. But its logic leads to death. The obsession with purity leads to destruction. The worship of the body leads to the annihilation of the body."
>
> "Mishima made this visible. He lived fascism's aesthetic to its logical end."

Leave them with the question, not an answer:

> "Why do you think the pursuit of beauty, strength, and purity led Mishima to death? What does that tell us about fascism?"

## Teacher Notes

### Why Mishima
Most fascism curriculum focuses on ideology and history. Mishima lets students encounter fascism's aesthetic dimension directly: the beauty, the seduction, the sublime. He's also impossible to dismiss as stupid or crude. His brilliance makes the encounter more disturbing.

### Handling the suicide
Be matter-of-fact about what happened. Don't romanticise it, but don't shy away from it either. Mishima himself framed it as a work of art; our job is to understand that framing, not reproduce it.

### The sexuality question
Mishima was almost certainly gay or bisexual. *Confessions of a Mask* is substantially autobiographical on this point. Some scholars argue his fascism was a response to sexual shame; others see his queerness and his fascism as parallel rather than causally linked. If students raise this, engage honestly: yes, this complicates simple readings.

### Film content
*Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters* is rated R. The clips suggested here are appropriate for high school, but preview them yourself. Avoid the more graphic final moments.

### If students are fascinated
That's the point. Mishima is supposed to be compelling. The question isn't whether he's attractive but what makes him attractive and where that attraction leads.

## Differentiation

| Student Need | Accommodation |
|--------------|---------------|
| Students who struggle with abstraction | Focus on biographical narrative and concrete details |
| Students who want to go deeper | Point them to *Confessions of a Mask* or *Temple of the Golden Pavilion* |
| Students disturbed by the content | Honour that; offer to talk after class |
| ELL students | Rely on "Plain English" translations in handouts; pair with supportive partner |

## Assessment

**Formative only.** Observe participation in discussion. Note how students are engaging with the aesthetic dimension, not just the ideological checklist.

This sets up [[05-Day-5-Synthesis|Day 5]]: students will apply Eco's framework to Mishima himself as their summative assessment.
