# Day 2: Contemporary Voices

## Unlabelled Rhetoric Encounter

**Duration:** 70 minutes (includes 5-min check-in)

## Purpose

Students encounter nine quotes from contemporary political figures without knowing who said them. They record reactions, make assumptions, then experience the reveal with context. The inclusion of Clinton, Biden, and Robinson as "outliers" sets up Day 3's crucial distinction: not all violent rhetoric is fascist.

## The Quotes (3-3-3 Structure)

### Foreign Right (Quotes 1-3)
1. **Viktor Orbán** — "We are not a mixed race" (racial purity)
2. **Giorgia Meloni** — "Ethnic substitution" + anti-LGBT (Great Replacement + natalism)
3. **Narendra Modi** — "Infiltrators" (coded anti-Muslim)

### Domestic Right (Quotes 4-6)
4. **Donald Trump** — "Poisoning the blood" (biological metaphor)
5. **Elon Musk** — "Actual truth" (endorsing antisemitic post)
6. **Andrew Tate** — "Belong to the man" (machismo + tradition)

### Liberal Imperialism (Quotes 7-9) — THE OUTLIERS
7. **Hillary Clinton** — "We came, we saw, he died" (Caesar language)
8. **Joe Biden** — "Unilateral strike to take them out" (preemptive nuclear)
9. **Selina Robinson** — "Nothing on it" (terra nullius)

**The pedagogical purpose of the outliers:** These quotes are violent, imperial, harmful — but they don't fit Eco's 14 Points. Students will discover this on Day 3. The distinction between "fascist" and "violent" is essential.

## Lesson Flow

### Check-In (5 min)

Standard community builder.

### Opening Connection (5 min)

> "Yesterday we talked about what people want when they feel overwhelmed, when their identity feels threatened, when the world doesn't make sense. Today you're going to encounter some voices that speak directly to those feelings."
>
> "Your job is to read, react, and guess. There's no trick, but there is a reveal."

### Distribute and Setup (2 min)

Distribute handouts face-down.

> "Don't flip yet. When you do, read silently. For each quote, write your honest reaction. Don't Google. Don't guess out loud."

### Initial Encounter — Silent Reading (15 min)

Students flip handouts and work through all nine quotes individually.

For each quote, they write:
1. What do you feel? (Name it: disgust, recognition, confusion, agreement, nothing?)
2. Who do you think said this? (Be specific: politician, activist, country, era?)
3. Would you share this approvingly, hide that you agreed, or strongly disagree? Why?

**Teacher moves:** Circulate silently. If students ask who said something: *"Write down your guess."*

### Pair Discussion (8 min)

Students pair up and discuss:
- Which quotes did you react to most strongly?
- Which speakers did you imagine similarly? Differently?
- Which quote doesn't fit with the others?

**No whole-class share yet.** Keep the tension.

### The Reveal (25 min)

Project slides. Go through each quote one at a time.

For each reveal:
1. Show the quote (students already have it)
2. Reveal speaker, role, source
3. Show context box
4. Pose discussion question (on slide)
5. Brief pair or small-group discussion (2-3 min per quote)

**Discussion Questions on Slides:**

1. **Orbán:** *Why would "purity" appeal to people who know their own ancestry is mixed? What does it offer?*

2. **Meloni:** *Why do anti-immigration and anti-LGBT show up in the same politician? What connects "ethnic substitution" to "the abyss of death"?*

3. **Modi:** *How does "protecting mothers and sisters" become justification for targeting others?*

4. **Trump:** *Why "poisoning the blood" instead of "taking jobs" or "breaking laws"? What does the biological metaphor do?*

5. **Musk:** *What can the richest man in the world say that you can't? What does owning the platform change?*

6. **Tate:** *What problem is he claiming to solve? For whom? What's the appeal?*

7. **Clinton:** [PLAY VIDEO] *Can you laugh at liberation? What kind of victory gets celebrated this way?*

8. **Biden:** *He's protecting his grandchildren. What about theirs?*

9. **Robinson:** *What do you have to say about people before you can take what's theirs?*

**Pacing:** Don't rush. Silence after reveals is productive. Let dissonance sit.

### Closing (5 min)

> "Keep this handout. We're going to return to these quotes."
>
> "Notice: some of these speakers probably surprised you. Some didn't. Tomorrow we'll get a tool for thinking about what connects some of these voices — and what separates them from others."

**Do not say the word "fascism" yet.** Let them arrive at it.

## Teacher Notes

### The outliers are the point
Students will be confused about Clinton, Biden, and Robinson. "Why are they in here with Orbán and Trump?" That confusion is the setup for Day 3. Don't resolve it today.

### If students ask "are you calling Biden a fascist?"
*"That's a great question. Hold onto it. Tomorrow we'll get a tool that might help you answer it yourself."*

### If students recognise speakers
That's fine. The point is the pattern across all nine, not the gotcha.

### If students find some quotes appealing
That's the point. Don't shame. *"Notice that. We'll talk about why this rhetoric is designed to be appealing."*

### Connection to Day 1
Make explicit links:
- *"Remember the message that would appeal to someone feeling powerless? What promises did you hear today?"*
- *"We talked about identity under threat. Which quotes speak to that?"*
- *"You discussed enemies and belonging. How do these quotes use those dynamics?"*

## Differentiation

| Student Need | Accommodation |
|--------------|---------------|
| ELL students | Pair with supportive partner; vocabulary support available |
| Students who struggle with ambiguity | Reassure that frameworks are coming tomorrow |
| Students who check out | Give specific observation task during reveals |
| Students who find quotes appealing | Don't shame; note for follow-up |

---

## Assessment

**Formative only.** Observe:
- Are students engaging honestly with the appeal question?
- Do they notice patterns without prompting?
- How do they process the reveal?
- Are they confused by the outliers? (Good — that's the setup for Day 3)
